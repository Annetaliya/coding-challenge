/**Given an array arr[] of size n, the task is to rearrange 
 * it in alternate positive and negative manner
 * without changing the relative order of positive and negative numbers.
 * In case of extra positive/negative numbers, they appear at the end of the array.
 * The rearranged array should start with a positive number and 0 (zero) should be 
 * considered as a positive number.
 * Input:  arr[] = [1, 2, 3, -4, -1, 4]
Output: arr[] = [1, -4, 2, -1, 3, 4]

Input:  arr[] = [-5, -2, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0, -8]
Output: arr[] = [5, -5, 2, -2, 4, -8, 7, 1, 8, 0]

/**
 * Given a sorted array arr[] of integers (in ascending order), rearrange the elements in-place to form a wave-like array.
An array is said to be in wave form if it satisfies the following pattern: arr[0] ≥ arr[1] ≤ arr[2] ≥ arr[3] ≤ arr[4] ≥ ...
In other words, every even-indexed element should be greater than or equal to its adjacent odd-indexed elements (if they exist).

Note: The given array is sorted in ascending order, and modify the given array in-place without returning a new array.
